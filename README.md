Still searching for the best note taking solution...  
Oh well, **markdown** exists, **git** exists, throwing away sheets at the end of each semester is not "eco-friendly", so let's share those notes **on** teacher's notes **on** github!

Obviously, those notes **do not guarantee** any success. They are simply my personal notes on teachers' slides / material.
Clarifying all that, let's finish this readme with a tone full of hope:  
*We shall pass the semester together, or we shall join our forces again, on September.* ðŸš€
